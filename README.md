Climate change is a pressing global issue, and understanding the role of climate changers is crucial. The term "climate changers" refers to factors or agents that contribute to rising global temperatures and associated environmental consequences. Some key climate changers include:

Greenhouse gases (CO2, methane, etc.) released through human activities (industrial processes, transportation, agriculture)
Deforestation and land-use changes (e.g., forest clearance for agriculture or urbanization)
Population growth and consumerism driving increased energy consumption and resource extraction
